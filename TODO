		High-Priority Features (For version 0.1.1)

 * Add support for routing of host irq to guest irq based on device tree 
   configuration. This will allow us to implement pass-through hardware 
   access for guest using device tree configuration.
 * Add support for sleep in scheduler. 
 * Add support for waitqueues along with a test suite. This will use sleep 
   support of scheduler.
 * Add support for completion, semaphore, and mutex locking mechanisms along 
   with a test suite for each. This will use sleep support of scheduler.
 * Update character driver to support interrupt driven using completion locks.
   This will greatly increase our performance in guest.
 * Upgrade scheduler to prioritized round-robin from simple round-robin


		Medium-Priority Features (For version 0.2.0)

 * Add support for bottom halves like workqueues for device drivers
 * Add support for real-time clock virtualization
