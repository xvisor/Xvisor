		High-Priority Features

-> Add support for routing of host irq to guest irq based on device tree 
   configuration. This will allow us to implement pass-through hardware 
   access for guest using device tree configuration.
-> Add support for sleep in scheduler. 
-> Add support for waitqueues using sleep support of scheduler.
-> Add completion, semaphore, and mutex locking mechanisms using waitqueues
-> Update vserial and chardev access functions to make them sleepable. This 
   will greatly increase our performance in guest.


		Medium-Priority Features

-> Add support for bottom halves like workqueues for device drivers
-> Add support for SMP systems.
-> Add support for telnet daemon.


		Low-Priority Features

-> Add support for frame buffer virtualization
