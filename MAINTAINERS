			Xvisor Initiators

This project was started by Anup Patel as an experimental test code.
Later, Himanshu, Pranav, and Sukanto joined Anup to re-designed/re-write it
from scratch and make it flexible & portable accross architectures.

	Maintainers List (try to look for most precise areas first)

Note: This list is meant to remain in alphabetical order. If you could 
add yourselves to it in alphabetical order that would be so much easier [Ed]

P: Person
M: Mail patches to
L: Mailing list that is relevant to this area
W: Web-page with status/info
T: SCM tree type and location.  Type is one of: git, hg, quilt.
S: Status, one of the following:

	Supported:	Someone is actually paid to look after this.
	Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it.
	Odd Fixes:	It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
			much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..
	Orphan:		No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
			role as you write your new code].
	Obsolete:	Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
			it has been replaced by a better system and you
			should be using that.

F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	F:	drivers/net/	all files in and below drivers/net
	F:	drivers/net/*	all files in drivers/net, but not below
	F:	*/net/*		all files in "any top level directory"/net
   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
X: Files and directories that are NOT maintained, same rules as F:
   Files exclusions are tested before file matches.
   Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance:
	F:	net/
	X:	net/ipv6/
   matches all files in and below net excluding net/ipv6/
