		Xvisor Version Scheme

The Xvisor Version Scheme is intended to capture the progress of Xvisor 
in-terms of feature additions. 

The Xvisor Version Scheme is as follow:

 1. We use 3 numbers major, minor, and release for version numbers. 
    We write this in following format: 
               <major> . <minor> . <release>
 2. We will increase <release> number after 5+ feature additions. 
    The addition of new port, driver, emulator, library, command, and daemonts
    will also be considered as new feature.
 3. The range of <release> number will be 0 to 2 (i.e 0, 1 and 2). 
    After <release>=2 we will increase <minor> number and set <release> to 0.
 4. There will be no limit on <minor> release number, it will keep increasing.
    The <minor> number will be reset 0 only when we increment <major> number.
 5. Increasing <major> number will be based on discussions on xvisor-devel 
    mailing list.

In the above, points 2 and 3 are based on our current pace of development. 
In future, we will keep adapting points 2 and 3 based on pace of development 
at that time such that <minor> number will increase at a steady rate.
