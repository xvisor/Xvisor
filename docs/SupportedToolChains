		Xvisor Supported toolchains

There are many cross compiler toolchains out there, but we cannot
guaranty that they would all work with Xvisor code.

Therefore we do recommend to use the cross toolchains available
from kernel.org as a reference.

You can find them at https://www.kernel.org/pub/tools/crosstool/

The reasons for preferring kernel.org cross toolchains are:
1. Its unaltered open-source GCC compiled using crosstool
2. No libc is present so if we accidently include any c library header
   then compilation will fail

The above is true to compile Xvisor itself (or the guest linux kernel
for the matter).

You will still need a glibc based cross toolchain to build the 
RootFS user space image, but that's this should be a one time
thing. For this purpose you could use proprietary tooolchain 
(such as codesourcery) or the Linaro toolchain for example.
 
Note however that We will not restrict users from using their favorite
GCC flavour to compile Xvisor.

Our stand on toolchains is as follows:
1. Xvisor will always compile & work using vanilla GCC from
   gcc.gnu.org or kernel.org without any c library.
2. We will not entertain bugs or issues manifested by using a
   particular flavour or modified GCC
