		Xvisor on Linaro QEMU Vexpress-A15 Host
		  (Without Virtualization Extensions)

This readme explains how to build & run Xvisor for Vexpress-A15 emulated by
QEMU Linaro 2.02 or higher. 

By default, Xvisor for Vexpress-A15 supports Realview-PB-A8 guest so we will
show how to run Basic Test on Realview-PB-A8 guest. For more info on Basic Test
refer <xvisor_source>/tests/arm32/pb-a8/basic/README.

Please follow the steps below to build & run Basic Test on Realview PB-A8 guest
with Xvisor running on QEMU Vexpress-A15 Host:

  [1. Build environment for Xvisor]
  # CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

  [2. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [3. Configure Xvisor with Vexpress-A15 default settings]
  # make ARCH=arm vexpress-a15-defconfig 

  [4. Build Xvisor]
  # make

  [5. Build Basic Test Code]
  # make -C tests/arm32/pb-a8/basic

  [6. Launch QEMU Linaro 2.02 or higher]
  # qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a15 -display none -serial stdio -kernel build/tests/arm32/pb-a8/basic/qemu.img

  [7. Kick Guest for starting Basic Test]
  XVisor# guest kick -1

  [8. Bind to virtual UART]
  XVisor# vserial bind guest0/uart0

  [9. Say 'hi' to Basic Test Code]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test# hi

  [10. Say 'hello' to Basic Test Code]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test# hello

  [11. Check various commands of Basic Test Code]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test# help

  [12. Enter character seqence 'ESCAPE+x+q" return to Xvisor prompt]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test#
