		Basic Test on Realview PB-A8 Guest

The basic test code currently sets up PIC, Timer, and UART and emulates a
dummy terminal which reponds to 'hi' and 'hello' commands.

Hardware features tested by Basic Test:
  - Sensitive non-priviledged instructions (not all but most of them)
  - Virtual IRQs
  - Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC)
  - PrimeCell Dual-Mode Timer (SP804)
  - Serial Port (PL011)  

Please follow the steps below to build & run Basic Test on Realview PB-A8:

  [1. Build environment]
  # CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-; cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [2. Configure Xvisor with Realview PB-A8 default settings]
  # make ARCH=arm pb-a8-defconfig 

  [3. Build Xvisor]
  # make

  [4. Build Basic Test Code]
  # make -C tests/armv7a/pb-a8/basic

  [5. Launch QEMU]
  # qemu-system-arm -M realview-pb-a8 -display none -serial stdio -kernel build/tests/armv7a/pb-a8/basic/qemu.img

  [6. Kick Guest for starting Basic Test]
  XVisor# guest kick -1

  [7. Bind to virtual UART]
  XVisor# vserial bind guest0/uart0

  [8. Say 'hi' to Basic Test Code]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test# hi

  [9. Say 'hello' to Basic Test Code]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test# hello

  [10. Enter character seqence 'ESCAPE+x+q" return to Xvisor prompt]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test#
