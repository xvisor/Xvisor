		Basic Firmware on VExpress-A15 Guest

The basic firmware currently sets up PIC, Timer, and UART and emulates
a dummy terminal which reponds to various commands. It also includes an
extensive MMU test suite and dhrystone benchmark.

Hardware features tested by Basic Firmware:
  - Sensitive non-priviledged instructions
  - Virtual IRQs
  - Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC)
  - PrimeCell Dual-Mode Timer (SP804)
  - Serial Port (PL011)  

Please follow the steps below to build & run Basic Firmware on VExpress-A15
Guest with Xvisor running on QEMU VExpress-A15 Host:

  [1. Build environment for Xvisor]
  # CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

  [2. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [3. Configure Xvisor with VExpress-A15 default settings]
  # make ARCH=arm vexpress-a15-defconfig 
  # make menuconfig (select 'VExpress Options' -> '1x vexpress-a15 guest' under DTS configuration) 

  [4. Build Xvisor]
  # make

  [5. Build Basic Firmware]
  # make -C tests/arm32/vexpress-a15/basic

  [6. Create fast_model_boot.axf for running it on ARM Fast Models]
  # ./tools/scripts/memimg.py -a 0x80010000 -o build/fast_model_boot.img build/vmm.bin@0x80010000 build/tests/arm32/vexpress-a15/basic/firmware.bin@0x81000000
  # cd build/; ${CROSS_COMPILE}gcc -nostdlib -march=armv7-a -mcpu=cortex-a15 -e start_boot -Wl,-Ttext=0x80000000 -DSMP -DVEXPRESS_A15 -DGIC_DIST_NONSECURED ../docs/arm/fast_model_boot.S -o fast_model_boot.axf; cd ..

  [7. Launch ARM fast models 7.0 or higher]
  # model_shell <your_fastmodel_dir>/FastModelsPortfolio_xxxx/examples/RTSM_VE/Build_Cortex-A15x1/Linux-Debug-GCC-3.4/cadi_system_Linux-Debug-GCC-3.4.so build/fast_model_boot.axf

  [8. Kick Guest0 for starting Basic Firmware]
  XVisor# guest kick guest0

  [9. Bind to virtual UART]
  XVisor# vserial bind guest0/uart0

  [10. Say 'hi' to Basic Firmware]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# hi

  [11. Say 'hello' to Basic Firmware]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# hello

  [12. Check various commands of Basic Firmware]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# help

  [13. Enter character seqence 'ESCAPE+x+q" return to Xvisor prompt]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# 

  (Note: replace all <> brackets based on your workspace)
  (Note: the above steps assumes Xvisor running on VExpress-A15 host emulated
   by QEMU 0.14.xx or higher. For other types of ARM host some of the above 
   steps will need to be adapted for that specfic ARM host. For more info on 
   your desired ARM host refer docs/arm/)
