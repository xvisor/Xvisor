			Virt-v8 Guest

The Virt-v8 is a fully para-virtualized guest with ARMv8 CPUs.

We only have memory mapped VirtIO devices for IO and this makes the 
Guest as fully para-virtualized. 

The memory map and irqs in Virt-v8 guest is as follows:
0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000FFFFFF (16M) (NOR Flash)
0x000000002C001000–0x000000002C001FFF (4K)  (GIC Distributor Interface)
0x000000002C002000–0x000000002C002FFF (4K)  (GIC CPU Interface)
0x0000000040200000–0x0000000040200FFF (4K)  (IRQ=40) (VirtIO Network Device)
0x0000000040400000–0x0000000040400FFF (4K)  (IRQ=41) (VirtIO Block Device)
0x0000000040600000–0x0000000040600FFF (4K)  (IRQ=42) (VirtIO Console Device)
0x0000000080000000-0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (---) (RAM)

In addition, we also have ARMv8 generic timer accessible to all VCPUs
of the Guest with virtual timer irq 27 and physical timer irq 30.
